# MRI_Classification_of_brain_tumors_using_ANN_techniques
Academic Project

The dataset was selected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri?select=Training)

Working with the TensorFlow library and Keras API I created 3 Artificial Neural Networks techniques that classified scanned brain images into classes regarding brain tumors. The highest accuracy (92%) was achieved from Convolutional Neural Network. The other models used for the image processing were Multi-Layer Perceptron and ResNet50. The project has been done in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.8 using TensorFlow and Keras.
